          Simone Segouin was a French teenager who bravely fought on the front
          lines against the German occupiers, and helped liberate the historic
          city of Chartres.

          Born in 1925 in Thivars, 55 miles from Paris, Simone was a tomboy with
          three brothers who taught her how to fight. She was especially close
          with her father, a patriotic farmer who served his country with
          distinction in the Great War (WWI.)

          In 1940 the Germans marched into France and began a brutal occupation
          that would last four long years. Filled with love of her country and
          admiration for her veteran father, Simone was determined to find a way
          she could help, even as a teenage girl. She joined the Francs-Tireurs
          et Partisans – a resistance group – and took the nom de guerre Nicole
          Minet. Simone was provided with false identity papers showing “Nicole
          Minet” to be from the Channel port of Dunkirk. This was a wise move
          because the port was bombed at the beginning of the war so it was
          impossible for them to verify her papers.

          Simone stole a bike from German soldiers and painted it to avoid
          detection. It became her “reconnaissance vehicle” and she used it to
          move around without attracting notice so she could deliver messages
          and snoop around. Simone/Nicole underwent intensive military training
          to be a combat soldier. She carried out multiple acts of sabotage
          against German targets, helping to blow up bridges and supply lines.

          While helping capture German troops in Thivars, she fell in love with
          Roland Boursier, commander of the resistance operation in her
          hometown. He was in hiding after killing a group of German soldiers.
          Since he couldn’t leave his hiding place in the countryside, Simone
          became his courier, taking messages to the main Resistance group.

          Simone helped liberate the historic city of Chartres, home of the
          famed cathedral, in August 1944. Afterwards, General Charles de
          Gaulle, the Free French leader and future president, visited the city
          and gave a speech at the city square. Journalists covering the event
          were fascinated by the sweet-looking girl eating a baguette with jam –
          and carrying a machine gun. She proudly told the reporters that she
          was part of General de Gaulle’s security detail. Simone was
          interviewed by an American reporter for Life magazine, and
          photographed by famed war photographer Robert Capa.

          After Chartres was liberated, Simone joined France’s 2nd Armored
          Division heading to Paris, where a brutal battle was taking place. The
          2nd Armored Division helped defeat the Germans and bring freedom to
          the City of Light.

          Simone was asked if she’d ever killed anyone. She answered, “On July
          14, 1944, I took part in an ambush with two comrades. Two German
          soldiers went by on a bike, and the three of us fired at the same
          time, so I don’t know who exactly killed him. You shouldn’t have to
          kill someone like that. It’s true, the Germans were our enemies, it
          was the war, but I don’t draw any pride from it.”

          After the war ended, Simone was promoted to lieutenant and awarded the
          prestigious Croix de Guerre.

          She became a pediatric nurse in Chartres and raised six children. Now
          94, she lives in Courville-sur-Eure, where a street was recently named
          after her. Mayor Frederic Hallouin described Simone as “A rebellious
          spirit, a strong character certainly, who took her father’s example
          and rejected the enemy occupying our country.” Simone said, “I’m very
          glad to know that people are not indifferent to this period of my
          life.”
